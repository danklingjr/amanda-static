                    <p>My husband has been bugging me for years to start a “mommy blog”. “What am I going to write about?” I’d say. “I have nothing to say that anyone wants to read,” I’d tell him. I’m pretty sure most of the time he’d just roll his eyes at me. If you know me, you know I almost always have something to say. Right now I have so much to say that I’m not sure where to begin. I guess an appropriate first post would be - why? Why do I want be a surrogate? And by the way, what in the world is a surrogate?</p>

                    <p>A surrogate, or gestational surrogate (GS) or gestational carrier (GC) is a woman who carries a child for someone who is unable to carry their own child. This could be a gay couple, a single man who desires a child, a single woman unable to carry, or a traditional couple where the woman is unable to carry. As a gestational surrogate, the child(ren) I carry will not be genetically related to me. The baby will start from the egg and sperm of his parents. The baby could also start with donor eggs or donor sperm or both. A reproductive endocrinologist (RE) will fertilize the egg with the sperm and allow it to grow for 3-6 days and then it will either be transferred fresh into the surrogate, or as in my case, frozen until the surrogate is ready, then thawed for transfer. ‘Transfer’ means the embryo will be inserted into my uterus by means of a very small catheter via my cervix. This is in vitro fertilization (IVF). I’ll explain more about the IVF process in a different post.</p>

                    <p>Now before I get questioned on why I would do this, I’ll tell you. I’m sure a lot of people aren’t surprised that I want to do this because I make it pretty obvious that I love the process of pregnancy and birth. I’m about to become a doula which is someone who lives and breathes birth for goodness sakes! Seriously though, I just feel like it is something that I have the ability to do fairly easily (not that IVF is easy at all, nor is pregnancy really a walk in the park per se, but my body does it well) so why not? Infertility is something that is far larger an issue than most people realize. Infertility affects 6.7 million American women. That is 11% of women who are of “reproductive age,” or approximately 1 in 10 women. Infertility is considered someone who has tried to conceive a child for at least 12 months without success. I guarantee that whether you are aware of it or not, you know someone, are related to someone, or work with someone, who has struggled with or is struggling with infertility. The reasons are many, from unexplained inability to carry, pcos, endometriosis, tubal issues, hormonal imbalances, all the way to a deformed or absent uterus. Dan and I decided to get pregnant in December of 2009 for the first time. By early in March of 2010 we learned we were pregnant. We decided in August of 2011 that we were going to try that month for #2, in September were were pregnant. The same thing happened in August/September of 2013. I am well aware that we are blessed beyond measure to have had 3 perfectly healthy pregnancies resulting in 3 perfectly healthy children. It is just not fair to me that there are so many people who want to have a biological child but are unable to. I may not be able to help 6.7 million women have a child, but right now I can help one. Families are made in many different ways, and for S and A, surrogacy is how their family is going to be made. I am so honored that they chose me for this extremely sensitive and special task! </p>
